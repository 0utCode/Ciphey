The Settings File
=================

The settings file contains settings for Ciphey. Specifically, some of these you may want:
* REGEX list. Have a list of REGEX's for the REGEX checker? Use the settings file.
* Default language. Hate how Ciphey always loads in English? Use the settings file to change the default language to whatever you want.
* Is the language checker not working how you want it to work? Fine-tune the details in the settings file.

Default settings file
---------------------
Save this as settings.yml in the appdirs location, which can be found by running ciphey --appdirs.
